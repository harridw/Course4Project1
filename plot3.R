#  Coursera: Data Science Specialization: Course 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis
#  Peer-graded Assignment:  Course 4 Project 1  [Course4Project1]
#  
#  Assignment Requirements / Guidelines:
#  Source data is text file 'household_power_consumption.txt' in working directory
#
#  NOTE: (per instructions in section 'Loading the data')
#  We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read
#  the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those
#  dates.
#
#  Review Criteria
#  1.	Was a valid GitHub URL containing a git repository submitted?
#  2.	Does the GitHub repository contain at least one commit beyond the original fork? 
#  3.	Please examine the plot files in the GitHub repository. Do the plot files appear to be
#     of the correct graphics file format?
#  4.	Does each plot appear correct? 
#  5.	Does each set of R code appear to create the reference plot?
#
#  setwd("/Users/harridw/Development/Coursera/Course4/Course4Project1")  ## Defines my working directory
